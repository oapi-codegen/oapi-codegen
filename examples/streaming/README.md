OpenAPI Code Generation Example - Streaming

This directory contains an example server using our code generator which implements
a simple streaming API with a single endpoint.

This is the structure:
- `sse.yaml`: Contains the OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- `stdhttp/`: Contains the written and generated code for the server using the standard http package
