//User templates are passed a struct that has two fields, spec and ops, described below.

///////////
// spec //
/////////
//`spec` is essentially the full parsing of the openapi file. https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/getkin/kin-openapi/openapi3#T
//This can be used to generate theoretically anything that is desired.
//Using this data however can be somewhat complicated as it is missing certain pre-processing steps otherwise handled by oapi-codegen.

//This example pulls in data from the Info section of the api and creates a simple comment
/*
This file was generated from the Generate models openapi file.
This is a simple api file for showing off some of the cool things you can do with user-constructed api generation templates.
*/

//////////
// ops //
////////
//`ops` is an array of Operation Definitions. https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/v2/pkg/codegen#OperationDefinition
//An operation is created for each `paths.{endpoint}.{method}`. so that the template does not have to parse the endpoint and path parameters individually.

//This example will output a simple comment for each of the operations defined in api.ymal.
//GetClient can be quired by sending a GET request to /client
//UpdateClient can be quired by sending a PUT request to /client
